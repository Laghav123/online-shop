These are some general notes that I need to take while creating project

- What if we Discovery Server goes down in between??
If so, nothing will happen. Because our client create a local copy of all services registered with
Discovery Server, and when it is down the client will use its local copy to send request.

- What is Inventory service goes down??
If all instances of inventory service goes down, then the services making request to it will not
get any response and will give error

- What if Inventory Service comes up again? Will it be able to register with Discovery Server?
Yes, all services connected to Discovery Server send heartbeats every 30 seconds

- What is API Gateway? Why do we need them?
API Gateway is a service which acts between client and other microservices. This isolates
microservices from end user.
When working on local machine we have constant connection links with port values. But this is not
the case when application is deployed on web. There will be multiple instances os a service and
each instance will be running on different port. API Gateway comes handy in this situation
to route requests based on headers.

- Other perks of API Gateway
Its basic need is routing requests based on header. But it has other benefits as:
a) Can act as Authentication Server
b) Provide Security
c) Can act as Load Balancer
d) SSL Termination (no https beyond API Gateway)
